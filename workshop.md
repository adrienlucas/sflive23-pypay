Payment Processing with Symfony's Workflow and Messenger Components
Overview

In this one-day workshop, attendees will learn how to use Symfony's Workflow and Messenger components to implement a payment processing system. The workshop will cover the basics of these components, as well as some more advanced usages, all within the context of a real-world payment processing use case. Attendees should have intermediate knowledge of PHP and web development.
